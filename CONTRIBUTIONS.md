# Contributions
Below is a listing each team member’s contributions to the project. 

## Dawn Varughese
Dawn was responsible for completing the bulk of the backend of our project, which included managing the data and ensuring data was being transferred correctly. She also dealt with implementing the APIs used in our project. She also assisted with the front-end, and was a key part in ensuring the design part of our application was taken care of. She created the original design plan of what our front-end would look like, and ultimately helped add and change to that design. She also filmed the video demo that was submitted, and ensured there were no major bugs in the final submission.

## Aayush Patel
Aayush worked on the README file for the project. In addition, he contributed to the front-end of the project by creating the basic workspace and template of what the aplication was to look like.
He did the necessary research to see how the MERN stack could properly be implemented in the project, and also looked into seeing whether all the APIs and configurations were working together correctly. He also helped with some of the testing and ensuring the testing suite was running in a proper way so that there all the bugs could be fixed in a convenient time manner.
